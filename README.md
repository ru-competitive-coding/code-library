# Radford University - Programming Team Code Library
This monorepo contains the code library for the Radford University programming team, broken up by programming language.

## How to use this repository
The library into several subprojects based on programming language. Each subproject should be considered totally independent.

More usage details will be forthcoming, but the gist is this: Browse through the code, and copy snippets that you like, as they're
relevant for competitive programming problems. If you'd like to contribute to the library, keep reading.

## Universal Contribution Guidelines
Again, more to follow as this repo develops, but right off the bat you should know the following:
1. Each subproject is independent and individually licensed.
2. You **MUST** have the rights to any code you contribute. This means you either:
    1. You wrote the code
    2. You copied the code from a source that allows distribution. In this case, you **MUST** follow the terms of use and/or license
       of your source _and_ attribute your source in the source files themselves.
3. All contributed code must be effectively covered by (passing) unit tests.

## Per Project Setup
See the README included in each subproject for per-project setup instructions.
